The notion of a “sale” is disappearing. The economics of music is moving to touring. Radio is not what it used to be. As “popularity” has become more difficult to quantify, Billboard’s opaque algorithm continues to evolve. Over the summer, they changed their algorithm again and the music industry nervously awaited who would come out on top."},{"type":"text","value":"If you were in charge of Billboard, a small tweak in sources or weighting would change who the world considers its biggest star."},{"type":"text","value":"We culturally put so much into the notion of music popularity. Who was the biggest act of the 60s? The Beatles. The 80s? Michael Jackson. The 90s? Britney Spears. Today? Depends on the math. Imagine that: an algorithm completely determining our mental model of culture."},{"type":"text","value":"So when that algorithm changes, so does our mental model. For years, Billboard used radio as a gauge for popularity. In the early 1990s, radio-friendly acts like Michael Bolton dominated the charts. Then overnight, Billboard started using a process called “Soundscan,” where sales from record stores were directly reported to Billboard. Those sales now determined the ranking, and things culturally changed. We thought America was worshipping Michael Bolton. When the algorithm moved to Soundscan, the top artist ranking changed overnight to Nirvana and NWA, creating a sort of existential crisis around cultural significance in music. Were we wrong before? How should historians look back on this period in music...as an era of Bolton or NWA?"},{"type":"text","value":"We’re at a similar precipice today. Music consumption is radically changing, and we have so many new data sources for quantifying popularity. When historians look back on 2018, how should they report on the biggest acts in music?"},{"type":"text","value":"The Pudding team decided to split up and try to answer this question.
